.15in **Objectives:** This course is primarily designed for upper level
undergraduates and graduate students interested in programmatic,
spatial, data analysis. The course will serve as an introduction to the
extremely popular python programming language and the set of packages
appropriate for working with spatial data in python. We will also work
with ArcGIS Pro from time to time, although the course will not strictly
be focused around ESRI software.

.15in **Course Pages:**

1.  For course content, including the latest syllabus, lecture notes,
    and assignments:
    <https://github.com/tbartholomaus/GIS_programming_F21>

2.  For communication and collaboration regarding the course:
    <https://gisprogrammingf21.slack.com/>

We will also be using UIdaho's BBLearn website in some instances to
share course materials and assignments, and keep track of changes to the
syllabus and schedule. Please expect to keep track of this page.

.15in **Communication:** We'll be using Slack to communicate in support
of this class. Please sign up for slack and join the workspace at [this
link](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-h6m9869/shared_invite/zt-v2r6wz6p-07v6D3LenASwSkeYMdSDbQ).
Within this class workspace, you'll find channels for \# it_help and
other channels for each week's content and assignment.

Slack is a place to give and receive help, and to ask questions.
Collaborating through this medium, as with other approaches isn't
cheating, but is actually a sign of success. I hope that you will use it
frequently.

I generally don't enjoy getting email. But if you must have it, my email
address is tbartholomaus\@uidaho.edu.

.15in **Office Hours:** By appointment, Mondays from 2 to 4 on Zoom
(<https://uidaho.zoom.us/j/88966120490?pwd=dUs0YWtiakxOL1hpaWhDTVd1djZSZz09>,
aka, Meeting ID: 889 6612 0490, Passcode 548040), and on Tuesdays at my
office, McClure 307b. If you do not have a vaccine protecting you
against infection by COVID-19, please take advantage of my zoom office
hours, rather than attending in person.

.15in **Getting started and learning python:** There is an astounding
array of online resources for learning python, using it for geospatial
data analysis, and connecting it with the ESRI ecosystem. As such, we
have no required textbook for this course. I expect that you'll be doing
a lot of searching the web, and learning informally as we go. Stack
Exchange and Stack Overflow are excellent, high quality, community
resources. People ask questions there, and provide answers. You can
generally trust the answer with the greatest, or maybe second greatest,
number of "up-votes" to a given question.

That said, I highly recommend the following website resources, each
below as a link:

-   [Geo-Python, from the University of
    Helsinki](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

-   [Earth Analytics Bootcamp Course, and similar courses linked on this
    page, from the University of
    Colorado](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-bootcamp/)

-   [Scipy Lecture Notes, for learning the foundations of python for
    science purposes](https://scipy-lectures.org/)  

I am not, specifically, an expert in the use of ESRI software, although
I will share with you what I know about interfacing with ArcGIS Pro in a
programmatic way. For my own GIS purposes during research, I typically
rely on QGIS, an excellent, highly capable, completely free alternative
to ESRI's expensive software. Thus, if you have specific, advanced
questions about ArcGIS Pro, I may not be able to help you, although I
will do my best.

.15in **Learning Outcomes:** By the end of this course, students will be
able to read, plot, and analyze spatial data using python. Students will
learn to solve problems using multiple tools, including with open source
tools outside of the ESRI environment. Students will be able to
programmatically make and update publication-quality maps and figures.
Students will have facility in working with Open Street Map and Google
Earth Engine to programmatically draw on vast troves of data to solve
prescribed and independently conceived data analysis problems.

.15in **Course Structure and Assignments:** Assignments will consist of
programming activities that you will carry out via Jupyter Notebooks and
ArcGIS Pro projects. Each week during lecture, I will introduce content
and specific learning goals during lecture, we will proceed with a
period of in-class, hands-on exercises, and then deliver an assignment
for the following week.

At the start of each lecture class, each student will spend 5-10 minutes
presenting their progress on the assignment, pointing out places that
were specifically challenging, and any particular functions or
programming approaches that you found especially useful. In this way, I
expect that you will learn not only from me and from the independent
work you do to solve assignments, but also from the other students in
our class.

The final two class meetings are reserved for presentation of class
projects. Class projects will consist of a more significant effort to
answer a problem of your choosing, using the skills developed earlier in
the semester. For your final project, I expect that you will use the
markdown capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks more extensively to produce
a"final report" laying out the goals of your project, the rationale
behind your project, the methods that you pursue and any intermediate
results, and the final output of your project. Jupyter Notebooks, with
markdown are an excellent tool for exactly this kind of transparent,
shareable, and reproducible science. On the last day of class, December
9th, you will share these notebooks in greater detail than the typical,
weekly presentations.

.15in **Prerequisites:** Formally, this class requires having passed
GEOG 475, Intermediate GIS. This formal requirement can be excused with
permission of the instructor. Practically, this class assumes comfort
with raster and vector datasets, working with and maintaining an
organized computer file structure, and an interest in quantitative
analysis. Comfort with algebra and trigonometry will be assumed, but
please contact the instructor if any course content appears unfamiliar.

**Grading Policy:** Weekly assignments (70%), Class engagement (during
lecture and/or via slack) (10%), Project (20%).

.15in **Class Attendance:**

-   Regular attendance is essential and expected. In class, you'll be
    practicing skills and also presenting the results of your last
    week's work.

-   However, I expect that sometimes you won't be feeling 100%, whether
    via a cold or via covid. Please let me know in advance of these
    class meetings (Thursday morning) so I can try and make
    accommodations.

.15in **Academic Honesty and Collaboration:** You are welcome to discuss
the problem sets with your classmates, however the work that you present
each week must be your own. This class, and programming in general, is
somewhat different than others, in that \"borrowing\" liberally from
online sources is expected. If you're not googling to complete your
assignments, then you're probably not doing them right.

That said, while I explicitly expect and encourage discussing the
assignments with your colleagues and googling, for solutions, I expect
that you will present your own work during each class. Sharing whole
blocks of code verbatim as answers is unacceptable. Pointing your
classmates towards use of a specific python function, or helpful
website, is great.

.15in **Support for Disabilities:** I am committed to providing equal
access to students with disabilities. If you suspect that you will need
some form of accommodation to complete this class, please discuss it
with me. UI Center for Disability Access and Resources can assist. You
can learn more at <https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/cdar>.

.15in **Healthy Vandals Policies:** It is a longstanding tradition that
Vandals take care of Vandals, and we all do our best to look out for the
Vandal Family. Simple precautions go a long way in reducing the impact
of coronavirus on our campuses and in our communities. With everyone
engaging in these small actions, we can continue to participate in our
vibrant campus culture where we are able to learn, live, and grow.
Please bookmark the [University of Idaho Covid-19
webpage](https://www.uidaho.edu/vandal-health-clinic/coronavirus) and
visit it often for the most up-to-date information about the U of I's
response to Covid-19. Specific policies include:

-   **Vaccines.** Students across the university have been and are
    getting vaccinated. All Vandals are highly encouraged to be
    [vaccinated](https://www.uidaho.edu/vandal-health-clinic/coronavirus/vaccine).
    When you consider all of the people who are now getting sick,
    becoming hospitalized, and dying of COVID, 99 out of 100 haven't
    been vaccinated.

    If you are not vaccinated, I ask that you maintain additional, 6 ft
    social distance from me. I have a baby who is not yet able to be
    vaccinated, and I would feel terrible if I got sick despite my
    vaccine, and then gave the virus to my unvaccinated son.

-   **Face Masks.** Masks are required in all university buildings,
    regardless of vaccination status. This requirement will be reviewed
    periodically, and is subject to change.

    Masks must be worn over both the nose and mouth. If you are unable
    to, please contact [CDAR, the Center for Disability Access and
    Resources](https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/cdar) and let me
    know of your accommodation.

-   **Tracking your health.** Evaluate your own health status before
    attending in-person classes and refrain from attending class
    in-person if you are ill, if you are experiencing a cough, runny
    nose or congestion, a sore throat, headaches, fever or chills, or
    any other potential COVID-19 symptoms, or if you have tested
    positive for COVID-19 or have been potentially exposed to someone
    with COVID-19.

    Stay home if you experience any symptoms related to COVID 19 and
    that are not attributed to a non-infectious health condition
    regardless of how mild.

    Contact your medical provider or local Idaho Public Health District
    for assessment of symptoms and possible COVID-19 testing. Positive
    COVID-19 tests should be submitted via a VandalCare Report in order
    to make arrangements that involve classroom absences due to illness,
    and/or quarantine or isolation requirements directed by a medical
    provider.
