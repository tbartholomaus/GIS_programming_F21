    "# Assignment for week 03\n",
    "Vector Intro, Geopandas, CRS, Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading and Tutorials \n",
    "Inspired/following assignment from Dave Shean (https://github.com/UW-GDA/gda_course_2021/blob/master/modules/04_Vector1_Geopandas_CRS_Proj/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This week, we are going to cover several fundamental geospatial data concepts, including coordinate systems, projections/transformations, vector geometries (points, lines, polygons) and basic geometry operations (intersect, buffer, etc). We will also begin using the GeoPandas package (https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    ">“GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by shapely. Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and descartes and matplotlib for plotting.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We will revisit vector data and cover more advanced processing, analysis and visualization in a few weeks, after the Raster Intro module. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading and Tutorials\n",
    "Please read the following material before class on Thursday (especially important if you have limited GIS experience), and come with questions on topics that are unclear, so we can discuss together. There is some overlap in content, but they offer different presentations of essential material, so hopefully one or more will work for you, and some repetition will help solidify.\n",
