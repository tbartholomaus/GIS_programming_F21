    "## Reading and Tutorials \n",
    "Inspired/following assignment from Dave Shean (https://github.com/UW-GDA/gda_course_2021/tree/master/modules/03_NumPy_Pandas_Matplotlib)\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we are reviewing core Python modules: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. These are essential for the rest of the course and future data science endeavors (geospatial and otherwise). Most of the geospatial modules we use are built on these packages, so you must be comfortable with the underlying functionality. This review will ensure that we have a common baseline and set of references moving forward. **If you are relatively new to Python and these modules, it is critical that you spend extra time with self-study this week.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is intended to be an individual study. Tailor to your needs, and adjust emphasis so you are best using your time outside of class. Even if you’ve been using these tools for many years, it can still valuable to review, as you will inevitably learn (or re-learn) some new tricks and develop a better grasp of more complex concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous homework assignments, don’t wait until Thursday morning to start.  This material will be much more useful if broken up over several sessions throughout the week - try an hour or two a day. Again, if this is new, please dedicate the time to explore interactively, don't just skim rendered versions on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Data Science Handbook: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib (~2-6 hours)\n",
    "* Review the following sections of Jake Vanderplas’ “Python Data Science Handbook”\n",
    "https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/. Follow the same process of `git cloning` that you've done previously. Get through what you can, but if you're feeling overwhelmed or pressed for time, try to at least work through the first half of each section, which should cover most basic functionality.  \n",
    "   * **2. Introduction to NumPy**\n",
    "      * Can skip section on Structured Arrays (we'll use Pandas)\n",
    "   * **3. Data Manipulation with Pandas**\n",
    "      * If new to Pandas, can skip section on Hierarchical Indexing, Pivot Tables and High-performance Pandas\n",
    "   * **4. Visualization with Matplotlib**  \n",
    "      * Skip the section on \"Geographic Data with Basemap\" as this is largely outdated in 2021\n",
    "      * Can skip Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets\n",
    "* Work through some of the interactive examples, and explore new concepts (don't just shift-Enter as quickly as possible)\n",
    "* The section on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn is also great, but not required for this course\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Matplotlib Doc\n",
